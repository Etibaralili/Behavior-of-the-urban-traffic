# Behavior-of-the-urban-traffic
This project mainly analyzes the behavior of the urban traffic. The very first part is about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). 
EDA deals with the identification of average flood level and slowliness in traffic. 
Furthermore, the second part and the third parts are about modeling. Two type of models are chosen: Linear Regression and Generalized Linear Regression.
